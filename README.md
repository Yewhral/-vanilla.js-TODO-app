# -vanilla.js-TODO-app

This app was created for Firefox and Chrome as a training project for my JavaScript skills.
Creating this without following any tutorials allowed me to improve at handling parent-child relations in DOM.
It also taught me how to deal with styling checkboxes and dynamically generated content.
